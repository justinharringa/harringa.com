I've been contemplating using various password management solutions over the last year or more ([LastPass][lp], 
[KeePass][kp], [1Password][op]). I've finally made the jump and am starting to use it instead of remembering lots of 
different password schemes for different sites. I ultimately landed on [LastPass][lp] even though they had a 
[potential security breach][lp-breach]. The fact is that they handled it well and it seems that there was little, 
if any, impact due to the way they store their data. If you're looking for a great solution to manage your passwords, 
I'd recommend [LastPass][lp]. Check out [this great write-up on it on LifeHacker][lp-lh].
