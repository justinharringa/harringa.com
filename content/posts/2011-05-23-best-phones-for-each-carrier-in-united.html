<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The other day when I was thinking about really getting my blog going I thought it'd be great to post my picks for the best smartphones for each carrier. Well, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> beat me to the punch with their <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/smartphone-buyers-guide-the-best-phones-for-verizon-atandt-spr/">Smartphone Buyer's Guide</a>. I took a look at their picks and am in agreement for the main Midwest carriers. <br /><br />Generally, Android is the right platform if you're on Verizon (or most other carriers for that matter). If you're on AT&amp;T, your best bet is an iPhone because they haven't been good about releasing many decent subsidized Android phones. Of course, you might have a personal reason picking iPhone over Android or vice versa. If you're not sure, you can get a better idea of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5801862/top-10-awesome-android-features-that-the-iphone-doesnt-have">why Android is better than iPhone in some respects</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5804230/top-10-ways-ios-outdoes-android">why iPhone is better than Android in some respects</a>. If you know me, you know that I prefer Android. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />So, if you really need to buy a smartphone right now take a look at their guide. If you're on Verizon and can wait a few months, there are supposedly some better LTE phones coming down the pipe. </div>
