I've been working a little more on my [Raspberry Pi Temperature Monitor][pi-temp-monitor] and wanted to check out how to do some 
[Test-driven Development][TDD]. So, I started by looking into how I might write some tests and structure my code so I looked at the [Python 
unittest documents][py-unittest] and [class documents][py-classes]. I also ran into [this guide][py-guide] which was quite informative. 
I think it turned out alright (though I'm sure things may have evolved since 2009, when the guide was written. Like anything else, 
the code can be refactored and improved incrementally.
