I recently had Lasik surgery and it is absolutely wonderful. The specific method that they chose for me was IntraLase. The flap is loosened with a laser as opposed to a microkeratome blade so it lessens the possibility of infection (and it made me more comfortable with the procedure).

So far I have had excellent results. I can see very well and about the only negatives so far are that my eyes are dry, I see halos at night, and I'm somewhat sensitive to light. This should all heal over time though. So that's a positive.

Anyways, I better get cracking on my homework. That's all for now.
