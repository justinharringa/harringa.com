<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Alright, so I have been posting a lot about lasik and that's not in the spirit of this blog.<br /><br />Thankfully, I've got until October to correct that. However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/05/21/136522753/judgment-day-not-according-to-the-evidence?live=1%3Fsc%3Dfb&amp;cc=fp">some are speculating</a> that the <a href="http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html">end of days talk</a> isn't true. Gasp! Then again, maybe <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/rapture">God clicked too fast through the rapture installer</a>.<br /><br />Either way, I probably ought to help out in the <a href="http://eternal-earthbound-pets.com/">rapture pets market</a>&nbsp;so that I can attempt to undercut the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/21/136475372/after-the-rapture-who-will-walk-your-dog?sc=fb&amp;cc=fp">competitors</a>.&nbsp;</div>
