<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Alright, so I have been posting a lot about lasik and that's not in the spirit of this blog.<br /><br />Thankfully, I've got until October to correct that. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/05/21/136522753/judgment-day-not-according-to-the-evidence">some are speculating</a> that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110218190323/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html">end of days talk</a> isn't true. Gasp!
