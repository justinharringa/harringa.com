<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It's fairly obvious that I don't keep this up to date. I stumbled upon the blog again after getting Google Buzz. <br /><br />The results from my lasik procedure are fantastic. I haven't needed to use drops for more than a year. I would definitely recommend the intralase procedure at Wolfe Clinic. I don't really notice halos at all and my eyes haven't been abnormally dry. <br /><br />Happy Singles' Awareness Day!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw-0jKORj2A">Them Crooked Vultures - Caligulove (Live in Paris)</a></div>
