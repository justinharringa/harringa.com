Well, it has been about 3 and a half months since I had Lasik surgery at <a href="http://www.wolfeeyeclinic.com/">Wolfe Eye Clinic</a> and I continue to see better and better. At my last eye appointment I was able to read 20/15 in each eye. The dryness in my eyes has gone down quite a bit. Thanks, in part, to switching from drops that had preservatives in them to a drop that has a safe preservative. The halos have gone down significantly. Last night I drove home while I was tired and everything was extremely clear. I am very happy with my results and would recommend it to anyone who has a strong prescription.
